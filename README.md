Roll Character is intended to be a single-page web app that allows for the
dynamic creation of robust non-player characters, with a comprehensive
gender, attraction-model, and pronoun profile. They will also have an aesthetic,
a background, a quirk, a belief, and a trouble.


## To Run Roll Character

In the project directory run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## MVP
The current mvp of this project is a simple blank page, that displays a
dynamically generated NPC name, gender, attraction-model, and pronoun profile.
